This is a DES crypto tool written with Java(Software) and C++(DLL).   `Windows only`

Feel free to use it (this project is just for my final exam). The instructions are below.

*1. the Enc.dll is very essential and please don't move it.*

2 You can encrypt or decrypt the text and documents(.txt .doc .docx).  Run theMain.java.

3 Please first run CreatePassPort to get a **register code**, or you can't boost the software.

4 After registration you need to create a brand account for yourself.

5 For more detail (like the C++ code), please contact this mail *15931695205@163.com*
